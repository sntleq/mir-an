            <h2>THE SOUND</h2>
            <p>The sound the language is going for is mostly voiced. This is a priori conlang. This means that Mir-an words won't based by a particular natural langauge. <span class="grey">this makes it a bit slow(er)</span></p>
            <p>My conscript inspired me to make this language, compatible and of the same feel. It looks like Chinese Calligraphy so expect some oriental vibes. <span class="grey">you'll see</span>. In fact, some words are from Japanese, because of the very simple syllable structure. But, don't expect tones like in Chinese, I have no idea how that works.</p>
            <p> I want to keep the vibe, it's the character of the language. But, I also want to stray away to make it unique. <span class="grey">also its a priori</span></p>

            <h2>PHONOTACTICS</h2>
            <p><i>Mir-an's</i> phonotactical constraint is a simple <strong>(C)V(m, n, r)</strong>.</p>
            <p>All consonants in the inventory are allowed as onsets, but only m, n, and r are allowed to end syllables as codas. Consonant clusters and geminates are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Permitted diphthongs and triphthongs are /ja/, /ji/, /jo/, /wa/, /wi/, /wo/, /aj/, /aw/, /jaw/ and /waj/.</p>
            <p>Consecutive syllables should not have the same consonant as their onsets. ie. <strong>n</strong>o<strong>n</strong>am For this, other consonants can take the place of some consonants: [ɾ] for /d/, and [z] for /s/
There is also a similar thing for vowels, <i>Mir-an</i> tends to avoid the same vowel surrounding a consonant ie. <strong>a</strong>m<strong>a</strong>, but /o/ is an exception, ie. <i>iozonobor</i></p>
</section>
<section id="allophony">
            <h2>ALLOPHONY</h2>
            <p>Plosives are voiced intervocalically. ie. <i>bor</i> /por/ but <i>uozobor</i> /wozʊbor/ This may(?) happen with fricatives and the affricate too, but have not yet so far. For the case of /s/ and /z/ though, they're different phonemes so /z/ can also occur in the position of /s/ (not intervocalic position). Using the two can alter the meaning <span class="nosense">a bit</span>. <i>sar</i> and <i>zar</i> both means "light", but the former is in the physical and literal context, and the latter is in the more figurative and philosophical context. <span class="nosense">does this all even make sense?</span> In cases where the same consonant can't surround a vowel/diphthong/rime, it's like /s/ and /z/, and /d/ and /ɾ/ are in free variation. <span class="nosense">makes sense, no?</span> Lastly, /o/ raises to [ʊ] in unstressed syllables.</p>
</section>
<section id="stress">
            <h2>STRESS</br>AND INTONATION</h2>
            <p><i>Mir-an's</i> stress tends to be in the second or first syllable. Gotta learn more bout this yet.</p>
