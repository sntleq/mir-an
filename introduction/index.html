            <h2>WHY??</h2>
            <p>i only work on this mostly on my free time. being a priori conlang, mostly words are added just when something suddenly pops in my head. i am so excited for this to be fully functional, but i don't want to rush the process, i should make sure i don't go too slow either.</p>
            <p>making this website will help motivate me to work on it more often coz mostly i get lazy or i just don't simply know where to continue. i had a conworkshop page <a href="https://conworkshop.com/view_language.php?l=MIRN">here</a> but i dont understand the grammar forms, <span class="grey">(such a  noob)</span> and the words in my conlang can have different meanings and word classes. this way, i can work with two of my interests: conlanging and web development :) noob at both btw :)</p>
            <p>the website will be a bit more informal (i make them lowercase) especially here in the introduction, but it will get more formal as things go more technical and more confusing for a no0b like me. i will be putting "does this make sense?" tags(?) in parts where im not sure if it makes sense or im just playing around without thinking. <span class="grey">ye me no0b</span> please correct me if i do something wrong in these parts, or in other parts, assuming someone actually will read it :) <span class="grey">haha loner</span></p>
            <p>you found this either in reddit, discord, or both. you can feedback anywhere from the two, i'd be more than happy to read it especially i just learned some web dev and im still not as good with linguistic things as well :)</p>

        <section id="context">
            <p><i>Mir-an</i> is a language spoken in the old times by <i>The People of Mir</i>. They call themselves <i>Miro</i>.</p>
            <p>They live in yes, you guessed it right, <i>Mir</i>, an entire continent presently divided into eight regions, one being the capital of course, <i>Zanmir</i>. The name just literally says "middle land" because yes, you guessed it right again, it's the middle region. As the political system glides through time, the leader always gets called the <i>Dao</i>.</p>
            <img src="mir.png" alt="just some shitty worldbuilding">
            <p><i>Mir-an</i> literally means "language of Mir", that simple. As said earlier, <i>Mir-an</i> was spoken in the old times. I'm not yet sure if it will be used as frequently in the modern times. It's because the language is supposed to be simple, though not as simple as Toki Pona, but pretty sure it will be a bit hard to express modern concepts. I'm still working on very basic concepts and making sure words are short as possible to make room for more complex ones. This, I think, is the reason of my slow progress, when I make a word, I want it to be one-syllable only so I don't end up having long words when I start smashing them. <span class="grey">is this a real thing? longwordophobia?</span>
</p>
            <p>But anyways, despite the probably less usage of the language in the modern times, <i>Mir-an</i> will surely be used in maybe old traditional literature like poems. The people might even revive it if it actually dies like Latin or Hebrew. Pretty sure there is at least one <i>Miro</i> who speaks it here in Oar (Earth)  ;) <span class="grey">I just want somewhere to run to when the world just hate the entirety of me. <i>Mir</i>, it is :) ps: im fine :)</span> </p>
            <p><i>Mircho</i>, the writing system, is the reason why I started all of this. Transliterating English to it looks terrible so I decided to make a conlang for it. This is also why <i>Mir-an</i> is set in the old times. I'll discuss how it works in the orthography section.</p>
