                <h2>MIRCHO, AND</br>ITS HISTORY</h2>
                <p>Speakers write the language casually using brushes on papers and/or scrolls. They use <i>Mircho</i>, a vertical alphabetical writing system.</p>
                <p>I'll be explaining how it works in the next part, but for now, I'll be babbling about how <i>Mircho</i> came to be. I treat the changes I make in working with the conlang and the conscript as actual changes that the language has "gone through" in the conworld.</p>
                <p>Two years ago, I was just bored.. Nothing special, really. It just popped into my head that I'll make my "own alphabet". At that time, I previously have made two, but then I end up forgetting, so yeah, I'm making another one.</p>
                <p>Guess what I ended up with, it's the typical make-a-custom-shape-for-a-letter alphabet. I was done, then I was bored again.</p>
                <p>I wasn't satisfied, I had to work on another one after that. I want to make something unique, I have the whole summer break to work on it. I decided to just choose some sounds, not too many. Interestingly, I ended up choosing mostly voiced consonants, I really like how they sound, and just three vowels - a, i, o.</p>
                <p>At first, I was going for a featural alphasyllabary, I was planning to make a version <span class="grey">u mean rip-off?</span> of Hangul where it's just the sandwich stack, and syllables go down vertically.</p>
                <img src="../assets/hangul_stack.jpg" alt="hangul structure with letters stacked like a sandwich">
                <p> or just dominantly, at least. I remember considering to include a placeholder, but I dropped it anyways.</p>
                <img src="../assets/old_placeholder.jpg" alt="my idea for a placeholder before">
                <p>Hangul is featural, following the shapes of the speech organs.</p>
                <img src="../assets/hangul_mouth.png" alt="hangul glyphs follow the shape of the mouth and tongue" class="rotate">
                <p>However, I realized that as long as sounds with similar features have a common feature in the script as well, it is still featural. <span class="nosense">right?</span> I dont wanna just follow the shapes of the speech organs as well because it'll only end up as Hangul.</p>
                <p> I started making the glyphs, all broad and short. The template for the glyphs is a laying-down rectangle.</p>
                <img src="../assets/mircho_featural.jpg" alt="mircho's  f e a t u r a l  system">
                <p>Know that this is just what I remember it was. Others are just changing the form a bit. I ended up not using the /ŋ/ sound so I gave the glyph to /h/. Green indicates the changes or occurences made when I changed the form of the script a bit (more on that later). The glyph for /v/ actually occured to me because of this change. This change also made it possible to write /z/ by adding an additional stroke to /s/. The glyph for /tʃ/ is just /d/ with an additional stroke inside as well.</p>
                <p>For the vowels, I just made it similar to Hangul vowels, just that there are no vertical ones. I also had to make a different system for adding glides. Here are the basic ones:</p>
                <img src="../assets/vowels.jpg" alt="basic vowels of mircho, with glides as well">
                <p>It looked too much like Hangul tho. I don't want others to assume I'm learning Korean because of the K-Pop trend. I already knew about Hangul even before that, and I was really fascinated of how it works. I just have to know the glyphs, and I'll already know how they'll be put together into syllables.</p>
                <p>But it has to be unique in a way. Hangul (and <i>Mircho</i> as a result) is so geometric so what I did is I changed the angles of the glyphs, and added some touch of Chinese aesthetics in them some time after.</p>
                <img src="../assets/form_evolution.png" alt="how the form if the script changed" class="rotate">
                <p>Lines became curved, it added some flavor onto it. It also made some glyphs possible. This change made the /v/ glyph possible, based on the two strokes at the top of 公, 分, 分, as well as the additional tiny stroke in /z/ for voicing, and more like <a href="#punctuation">punctuation</a> and the placeholder, you know, Chinese has a lot of those tiny strokes, 火, 汉, which I like.</p>
                <p>The placeholder was under constant changes as well. It went from a vertical line, to Hangul's ㅇ, to an /h/ glyph with an additional stroke over it.</p>
                <img src="../assets/placeholder_evolution.png" alt="placeholder changes" class="rotate">
                <p>One day, I realized "Alphasyllabary? letters are stacked like a sandwich.. syllables are stacked like a sandwich as well.. wait, isnt that just an alphabet? letters next to each other, just that the flow is vertical".</p>
                <p>I couldn't really transliterate from English effectively because of its limited sound inventory, so I had to make a conlang for it!</p>
                <p>That is how <i>Mircho</i> and <i>Mir-an</i> came to be, at least this is what I remember so far.</p>

            <section id="writing">
                <h2>WRITING</br>IN <i>MIRCHO</i></h2>
                <p>In this section, I'm going to discuss how <i>Mircho</i> works and how to write with it.</p>
                <p>People of <i>Mir</i> write Mircho using brushes on scrolls/papers, they're not really strict with the stroke order. However, the blocky version of Mircho (the old version) is also used in carvings to make it easier to carve compared to the curvy, calligraphy style used on paper. This blocky version is also a very important part in Voncho, more on that later.</p>
                <h3>CONSONANTS</h3>
                <p>Here are the consonants.</p>
                <img src="../assets/consonants.png" alt="consonants in mircho">
                <p>As you can see, to write the /z/ glyph, you add an additional stroke to the /s/ glyph. The silent placeholder is written by adding a stroke to the /h/ glyph as well.</p>
                <p>The placeholder is placed necessarily with words that start with vowels which vertical stroke/s is/are on the horizontal stroke/s, such as the glyphs for /a/, /ja/, /aj/, etc. For other vowels, however, the placeholder is not necessary, placing it can show formality.<p>
                <h3>VOWELS</h3>
                <p>Here are the vowels, and the permitted diphthongs and triphthongs.</p>
                <img src="../assets/vowels1.png" alt="vowels in mircho">
                <p>To make rising dipthongs, you do this:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-with /j/, you add a horizontal stroke;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-with /w/, you add a vertical stroke.</p>
                <p>There is an exception, however. Just simply adding a vertical stroke to the /i/ glyph to make it /wi/ will just result in either the /a/ or /o/ glyphs. Instead, /wi/ starts with two horizontal strokes, then a vertical stroke is added in between them.</p>
                <p>To make falling diphthongs (only with /a/), you add an additional stroke below the rising counterparts.</p>
                <p>The glyph for the triphthong /waj/ is written by adding both a horizontal and a vertical stroke to the /a/ glyph.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="problem">
                <h2>THE VOWEL</br>PROBLEM</h2>
                <p>Was the vowel and polyphthong system fine??</p>
                <p>These vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs, however, when they come in contact with other vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs in neighbouring syllables, create a tiny bit of a problem.</p>
